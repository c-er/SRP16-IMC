# SRP16-IMC
The inter-module communication subsystem, built by Uday Shankar for the Monmouth Summer Research Program of 2016.

# Implementation
Details are [link](implementation.md "here")

# Usage
Documentation doesn't yet exist, but usage of the IMCClient class is what is necessary for modules, and should be fairly self-explanatory looking at the code.
Modification of IMCConstants for constants that span the entire IMC subsystem might be convenient as well.
